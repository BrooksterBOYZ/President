        <h2>Key Laws & Reforms</h2>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <h3>Healthcare Reform</h3>
            <p>We believe in a healthcare system that emphasizes personal choice and freedom. We will provide affordable options while empowering individuals to make decisions that best suit their needs. We advocate for reducing government intervention, allowing for a more competitive healthcare marketplace, and ensuring the stability of Medicaid and Medicare for those who need it most.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <h3>Criminal Justice Reform</h3>
            <p>We will work toward a criminal justice system that prioritizes law and order while also offering opportunities for rehabilitation. We support common-sense reforms to ensure that our system is fair and just. This includes focusing on rehabilitation for non-violent offenders, enhancing community policing, and maintaining strong support for law enforcement to protect our communities. We must balance justice with maintaining public safety.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <h3>Immigration Reform</h3>
            <p>We believe in strong, secure borders and a fair immigration system. Our immigration policy will be based on the rule of law, ensuring secure borders and welcoming legal immigration. We will address the issue of illegal immigration by strengthening enforcement and providing a pathway to citizenship for law-abiding, hardworking immigrants who contribute to our society.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <h3>Climate and Environmental Responsibility</h3>
            <p>We will approach climate change with a pragmatic, market-driven strategy. Our goal is to promote innovation and environmental responsibility without over-regulating American businesses. We support clean energy innovation through tax incentives for renewable energy and smart environmental practices that protect our environment while maintaining economic growth.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <h3>Economic Growth and Fair Wages</h3>
            <p>We will ensure economic growth through job creation, tax reform, and fiscal responsibility. We support tax policies that encourage growth, reduce unnecessary government regulation, and create a business-friendly environment. By lowering taxes and simplifying regulations, we will empower the American worker and encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. We support fair wages, but also recognize the need for balanced policies that do not harm small businesses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <h3>Infrastructure Investment</h3>
            <p>We will invest in America's infrastructure to create jobs and strengthen our economy. Our plan includes responsible investments in roads, bridges, and public transportation, prioritizing projects that will have the most impact on local communities and our national economy. We will ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently, and that projects are completed on time and within budget.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <h3>Protecting the Second Amendment</h3>
            <p>We support the right of Americans to keep and bear arms. We will stand firm in defending the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense. Our approach includes enforcing existing laws, ensuring that those who should not possess firearms cannot access them, and supporting responsible gun ownership with a focus on safety and respect for the Constitution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <h3>Education Reform</h3>
            <p>We believe in empowering parents and local communities to shape education. We will support school choice, including charter schools and vouchers, so that parents have more control over their childrenâ€™s education. We will also focus on vocational training to ensure that young people are prepared for the workforce, and advocate for an education system that upholds traditional values while preparing students for the future.</p>
