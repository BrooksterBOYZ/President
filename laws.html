                <h2>Healthcare Reform</h2>
                <p>We believe in a healthcare system that prioritizes personal choice and affordability. By reducing government overreach and fostering competition, we can lower costs and maintain Medicare and Medicaid for those in need.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="policy-item" id="criminal-justice">
                <h2>Criminal Justice Reform</h2>
                <p>Our justice system should balance law and order with fairness. We advocate for rehabilitation programs, community policing, and firm support for law enforcement to ensure both justice and public safety.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="policy-item" id="immigration">
                <h2>Immigration Reform</h2>
                <p>We support secure borders and a merit-based immigration system. Illegal immigration must be addressed with stronger enforcement, while providing a fair pathway to citizenship for law-abiding immigrants.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="policy-item" id="climate">

                <p>A balanced approach to environmental policies will promote clean energy innovation while protecting jobs. Tax incentives and technological advancements will drive sustainability without over-regulation.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="policy-item" id="economy">
                <h2>Economic Growth & Fair Wages</h2>
                <p>Lowering taxes and reducing regulations will empower businesses and workers. We support fair wages while ensuring policies do not burden small businesses, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="policy-item" id="infrastructure">
                <h2>Infrastructure Investment</h2>
                <p>Investing in roads, bridges, and public transportation will strengthen the economy and create jobs. Every taxpayer dollar should be spent efficiently, ensuring on-time and budget-conscious project completion.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="policy-item" id="second-amendment">
                <h2>Protecting the Second Amendment</h2>
                <p>We stand firm in defending the right to bear arms. Responsible gun ownership, enforcement of existing laws, and common-sense safety measures will uphold both freedom and security.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="policy-item" id="education">
                <h2>Education Reform</h2>
                <p>Parents and local communities should have greater control over education. We support school choice, vocational training, and curriculum transparency to ensure students are prepared for the future.</p>
